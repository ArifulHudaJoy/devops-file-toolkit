### 📌 Project Overview
A practical Python-based CLI tool developed to demonstrate core programming skills and system interaction. This project was built during my self-directed technical training period to master the fundamentals of file manipulation and DevOps logic.

### 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated
* **File I/O:** Reading, writing, and appending data safely.
* **Logic & Search:** Implementing search-and-replace algorithms within the filesystem.
* **Error Handling:** Using `os.path` checks to prevent system crashes.
* **Modularity:** Using functions to create clean, reusable code.

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script: `python app.py`
3. Follow the interactive menu to manage files and folders.
